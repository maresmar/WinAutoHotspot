# WinAutoHotspot
Autoruns Mobile Hotspot from Windows's Anniversary Update after the login

> It's crazy hack in every way. First, it checks the internet connection and then it opens Mobile Hotspot settings and presses 6 times TAB and SPACE. This is the way how it enables the Mobile hotspot... It's really crazy but there is no other way how to do it better now

## How to install or uninstall the app
You have to download the repository and run `install.bat` or `unistall.bat`. Then it will start the hotspot automatically after login. But **you should configure Mobile hotspot somehow**.
